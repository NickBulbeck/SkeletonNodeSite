# This is based on Brad Schiff's Udemy Course, his example site being for a fictitious
# travel agency. The name SkeletonNodeSite is to distinguish it from more specific and
# personalised sites I'll create alongside it.

# At the time of last commit, the structure of the repo and the purpose of the site are in
# a state of flux, as I'm still to decide on the best way of working. But I think I'm
# close to a settled approach.

# THIS version of readme.md is on the gulp-4 branch.
